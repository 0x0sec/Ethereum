        Creators upload content with a stipulated PG type rating. The rating then gets confirmed by moderators. Creators earn views when a user views, likes or loves their content. A portion of the funds from viewing content goes to paying the moderators for their service.

This is a basic description of the roles of each user type, for an understanding of what this project is trying to achieve. These definitions will probably vary from version to version.

#### Users
Users can consume content, buy and sell views, as well as report content, become creators, and earn moderator reputation points.

#### Creators
Able to upload content, and withdraw earnings. If a creator consistently uploads removable content they will get locked (unable to upload content) for a period of time. Every time they get locked it is for a longer (2.5x longer) period, and after the third lock, they are unable to upload content. 

#### Moderators
Are users (over 18) who have earned enough moderator reputation points to get paid for moderating. They can moderate content by saying what category within the strictly defined PG like categories. They can also flag content as removable. Removable content will get reviewed by 3 other moderators and removed if a majority vote agrees. Users can earn moderator reputation points by moderating already moderated content without knowing what the original moderator rated the content as.
