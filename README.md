---- 

I made this repo to collect all the experiments and learning projects I have done within the Ethereum ecosystem, mostly so I don't misplace them. 

#### Key

<h5>Types</h5>
</div>

**Educational:** These projects where to learn or experiment with a specific idea/concept/etc 
**Educational `SimpleBank`:** The base project,     `SimpleBank` is a very simple dApp, built in an easy to understand way. There are plenty of comments so that the wiring and contracts are no mystery. Variations of the `SimpleBank`, such as `SimpleBankWithENS` are the same simple dApp, but with it implementing a tool or project within the Ethereum space. These `SimpleBankWith`'s are designed to be easy to follow examples of implementing the tool or product, so that you can implement the tool in your own dApp with minimal confusion. 
**Projects:** These are my own projects or ideas I am working on.

<h5>Progress</h5>

**Coming Soon!** A planned project 
**WIP** Work In Progress. Currently under construction.
**Done, BCBR** The code is all there, But Could Be Refined.
**Done** To the best of my ability, it works, does what it is supposed to.
